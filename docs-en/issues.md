# Issue index
Updated 16 September 2026 (v0.4) for the ISSUE-002 database foundation implementation.
Each task's status is recorded in the table. Portable task files may link to GitHub Issues without changing their stable IDs.
Backend 001–007 and 013 complete before monelog-app Issue 008.

Issue 013 retains its original filename to preserve links, but its scope is full admin management. IDs remain stable; execute in the table's dependency order.

## Changes across the process
| Issues | Permission/lifecycle work |
| --- | --- |
| 001 | Service boundaries and current confirmed policy |
| 002 | is_delete bool/default/backfill, roles, versioned lifecycle, actor attribution and audit schema |
| 003 | Active-account authentication, current-role guards for reads/writes, explicit bootstrap |
| 004 | Concrete owner/admin CRUD contracts, exact isDelete field, Trash/delete/restore and versions |
| 005–007 | Scoped categories/transactions, boolean deletion/restoration, active-only reports |
| 013 | Full admin account/role and selected-user CRUD, audit and authorization suite |
| 008 | Enabled admin forms/actions and own/admin Trash/restore, immutable form target |
| 009 | Selected-owner admin exports and job/download reauthorization |
| 010 | Android/iOS owner/admin CRUD and flag lifecycle parity |
| 011 | Owner/admin template management, soft delete and restore |
| 012 | Owner/admin Drive/backup management, flag-preserving validated restore |

Use [access-control.md](access-control.md) as the permission matrix and [workflow.md](workflow.md) for each task.
A singular duplicate issue.md is unnecessary. If remote issues are created later, add their real URLs to the matching files/index and preserve these portable IDs.
